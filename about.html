<p>     Analogues of May is the solo musical project of singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and theatre-maker Sara Jarvie-Clark. It is the culmination of Sara’s last four years of
  songwriting and exploration in sound. Beginning with classical violin at the age of six, and then guitar and piano in her teenage years, the pursuit of multiple instruments has
  given her a varied skill set in composition and an affinity for wacky sonic experiences. Influenced by a range of artists and academics, the music of Analogues of May  inhabits elements
   of experimental folk, country, Americana, psychedelic rock, Jazz and chamber pop. <br><br>
   Sara regularly plays music with her mother, Suzanne Jarvie and her vocals can be heard on much of Suzanne’s
   2019 album In The Clear. In 2019 Sara graduated from Concordia University’s Theatre and Development program. An avid jack of all trades from a young age, her work spans multiple
   performative mediums including socially-engaged activist arts, puppetry, composition for the stage, acting, playwriting and musical direction. You can find her regularly collaborating with
   Clay and Paper Theatre in Dufferin Grove Park, riding her bike, looking for warm drinks and watching critical theory lectures on the old web.<br><br>
   Her musical and theatrical projects influence
   each other in constant reciprocity and it is the intersection of these creative expressions that has shaped the music on her self-titled debut album. <i>Analogues of May</i> will
   be released on the Wolfe Island Records label in September of 2021.
